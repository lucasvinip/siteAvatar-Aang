            The characters of "The Simpsons" are not yellow by chance,
             according to their creator, Matt Groening.
              "When it came time to choose the color,
               I didn't want conventional cartoon colors.
                An animator came out with the yellow Simpsons and as soon as she showed it to me I said,
                 'This is the answer!'

            The names of the main characters are inspired by Matt Groening's own family.
             His parents were Homer Groening (1919-1996) and Margaret Wiggum (1919-2013),
              who inspired the name Marjorie Simpson,
               Marge.
               Groening also has sisters named Lisa Groening and Margaret Groening,
             or Maggie.
